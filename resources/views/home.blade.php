                The Hornsby Bahá’í Centre of Learning (HBCL) is an educational institution, established for the benefit of the Bahá’ís, visitors and residents of Hornsby shire. It is a venue to facilitate community building and unity promoting activities and functions, all guided by the aspirations of the Baha’i Faith to utilise the insights of religion, science, and the arts for the spiritual and intellectual development of individuals, institutions and communities, be they children, youth or adults, as we confront the challenge of building a peaceful and sustainable world community in the context of an ever advancing civilization. This is the primary purpose and function of the Bahá’í Centre of Learning. All activities that fall under this category take precedence over any other activity and all programs held at the Bahá’í Centre of Learning must adhere to this unique purpose.
